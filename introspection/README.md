# Introspection
---
### Why must we choose you?
I like to code, its more like I want to improve my programming skills. I dont have much experience but I would like to learn more and more. And on a different note I am not an introvert but I do have 'stage fright', so I think joining the club might improve that situatuion apart from the general coding.
### What is your plan for the next 6 months?
I didn't have any plan before starting the tasks, but now I think I would like to learn more on JS, Python and also get more familiar with Linux. I am planning to solve more on platforms like hackerrank, codechef etc. I also plan to improve my algorithms, contribute to some project. But my plans might change after I explore new things. Finally I will have to score a good CGPA. 
### How would you contribute back to the club?
I will help the members from what I learn or know.
### Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
I think the selection process was good and fair enough. It gave me a plan for the future.
